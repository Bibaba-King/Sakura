## FAQs
### Can I get banned?
- Use at your own risk.
- However, there have been no bans in the ~2 year period that we have been using the method behind **R3nzSkin** and **Sakura**. So far **Sakura** is safe and undetected.
### Regions support?
- All regions, including **Tencent** server.
### Is Sakura a virus?
- Definitely not. It's a false positive. **Sakura** is open-source, you can also use your compiled version as well.
- Do not download **Sakura** from anywhere other than this repository. I am not responsible if your computer is infected with viruses by downloading **Sakura** from elsewhere.
> The skin changer as well as the injector uses some Win32 API's that aren't commonly used in normal programs. The project is open-source, so you are welcome to compile the skin changer on your own, otherwise disable your antivirus and add the folder with the binaries to the exclusion list.
### Why did you stop updating the source code?
- There are idiots selling copies of **Sakura** so I decided to stop updating the source code.
- But that doesn't mean I won't update **Sakura**. And every version I will update the offsets for you to compile yourself if you don't trust me.
- The source code only supports English, while the binary release supports all Riot server languages and has more utilities.
### How can I contribute?
- Just fork the repo and open a pull request or DM me through Discord. I will review it and give you access to the latest source code.
### Give Sakura a star if you like it :)
